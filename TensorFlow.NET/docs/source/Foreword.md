# Foreword

One of the most nerve-wracking periods when releasing the first version of an open source project occurs when the [gitter](https://gitter.im/sci-sharp/community) community is created. You are all alone, eagerly hoping and wishing for the first user to come along. I still vividly remember those days. 



TensorFlow.NET is my third open source project. BotSharp and NumSharp are the first two. The response is pretty good. I also got a lot of stars on github. Although the first two projects are very difficult, I can't admit that TensorFlow.NET is much more difficult than the previous two, and it is an area I have never been involved with. Mainly related to GPU parallel computing, distributed computing and neural network model. When I started writing this project, I was also sorting out the idea of the coding process. TensorFlow is a huge and complicated project, and it is easy to go beyond the scope of personal ability. Therefore, I want to record the thoughts at the time as much as possible. The process of recording and sorting clears the way of thinking.



All the examples in this book can be found in the github repository of TensorFlow.NET. When the source code and the code in the book are inconsistent, please refer to the source code. The sample code is typically located in the Example or UnitTest project.
